## How to use/install

### AEM as a Cloud Service

To deploy WKND to AEM as a Cloud Service, this project's source code must be deployed to AEM via Cloud Manager. 

1. Clone this Git repository
2. Push the `main` branch to your Cloud Manager's Git repository
3. Ensure a deployment pipline is configured to deploy the target branch/repo to the desired AEM as a Cloud Service env
4. Run the Cloud Manager pipeline
5. WKND will now be deployed to the target AEM as a Cloud Service environment

## Notes

### WKND Sample Content

By default, sample content from `ui.content.sample` will be deployed and installed along with the WKND code base. The WKND reference site is used for demo and training purposes and having a pre-built, fully authored site is useful. However, the behavior of including a full reference site (pages, images, etc...) in source control is *unusual* and is **not** recommended for a real-world implementation.

Including `ui.content.sample` will **overwrite** any authored content during each build. If you wish to disable this behavior modify the [filter.xml](ui.content.sample/src/main/content/META-INF/vault/filter.xml) file and update the `mode=merge` attribute to avoid overwriting the paths.

```diff
- <filter root="/content/wknd" />
+ <filter root="/content/wknd" mode="merge"/>
```
